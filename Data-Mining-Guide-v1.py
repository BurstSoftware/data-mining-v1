    ### What is Data Mining?
    Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, anomalies, and useful information from large datasets. It involves applying techniques from machine learning, statistics, and database systems to extract knowledge for decision-making, prediction, and problem-solving.
    """)

    # Core Concepts Section
    st.subheader("Core Concepts of Data Mining")
    st.markdown("""
    - **Large Datasets**: Data mining works with massive datasets stored in databases, data warehouses, or data lakes.
    - **Pattern Discovery**: The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and trends that aren't obvious through simple analysis.
    - **Techniques**:
      - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming.
      - **Statistics**: Methods for analyzing data, identifying correlations, and making predictions.
      - **Database Systems**: Tools for storing, managing, and retrieving large datasets.
    - **Actionable Information**: Insights are used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and gain a competitive edge.
    """)

    # Common Applications Section
    st.subheader("Applications of Data Mining")
    st.markdown("""
    Data mining can be applied in various domains to generate value. Examples include:
    - **Business Analytics**: Understand customer behavior, identify market trends, and improve marketing strategies.
    - **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious transactions and activities.
    - **Risk Management**: Assess and mitigate potential risks.
    - **Healthcare**: Identify disease risk factors and develop personalized treatment plans.
    - **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest products or content based on user preferences.

    st.markdown("""
    The accuracy and reliability of data mining results depend on the **quality of the source data**. Ensure:
    - **Completeness**: No significant missing values.
    - **Consistency**: Uniform formats and standards across datasets.
    - **Accuracy**: Data reflects the real-world scenario.
    - **Relevance**: Data aligns with the business or research objectives.

    Popular tools and libraries for data mining:
    - **Python**: Use `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PySpark` for data processing, machine learning, and big data.
    - **R**: Ideal for statistical analysis with packages like `caret`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`.
    - **SQL**: Essential for querying and managing large datasets.
    - **Tableau/Power BI**: For visualizing insights and creating dashboards.
    - **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and big data mining.
